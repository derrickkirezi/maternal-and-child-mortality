#Maternal and Child Mortality Analysis

##Overview

This project analyzes maternal, infant, and under-5 mortality trends across countries using publicly available datasets. The goal is to provide insights into long-term improvements, disparities, and country-level differences in child and maternal health outcomes.

The analysis was done using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, with cleaned and merged datasets prepared for visualization.

Datasets

Maternal Mortality – Maternal deaths per 100,000 live births

Infant Mortality – Infant deaths per 1,000 live births

Under-5 Mortality – Deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 live births

All datasets were downloaded from the World Bank/UN public health repositories and cleaned for analysis.
